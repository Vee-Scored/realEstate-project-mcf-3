## About-us 
    We are participating in an educational remote work-shop program called "MMS Connections" held by MMS One Stop IT Solutions originated in Myanmar. That program intends for those who are difficult to join on-campus educational work-shop programs. In that program, we are building web-applications to be familiar with the requirements of real-world web projects. Our team will perform as Front-End role in that program. Thanks.
